# Simulation of RNA transport in muscle fibers

## Description
We developed a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC)-based simulation to investigate how the different motion states available to RNAs affect their steady-state distribution in the myofiber cytoplasm. In the simulation, RNAs are allowed to move in the following states:

1. **low-mobility**: a slow diffusion state with a low range of diffusion coefficients (median \[3.9 x 10-4 µm2/s\])
