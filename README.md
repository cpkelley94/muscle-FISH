# Microtubule-based transport is required to distribute RNA and nascent protein in skeletal muscle

## Description
We used hybridization chain reaction fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization (HCR-FISH) to study RNA localization in _ex vivo_ skeletal muscle fibers. We find that mRNAs from many genes are distributed nearly uniformly across muscle fibers, despite discovering that diffusion of RNA away from nuclei is severely restricted in muscle. By automated image analysis and stochastic simulation, we discover that frequent directed transport of RNA along microtubules is required to disperse RNAs across the fiber.

All code used in this study for image analysis and RNA transport simulation is written in Python.
